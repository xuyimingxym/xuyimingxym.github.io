### About Me
My name is Yiming Xu (徐一鸣). I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Urban Information Lab](https://www.urbaninfolab.com/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with [Dr. Junfeng Jiao](https://soa.utexas.edu/faculty/junfeng-jiao). My primary research interest lies in developing and applying artificial intelligence to enhance the sustainability, efficiency, and safety of urban mobility systems. I earned my Ph.D. in Civil Engineering from the [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/), where I conducted research in the [Smart, Equitable, Resilient Mobility Systems Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/sermos-lab/) with my advisor [Dr. Xilei Zhao](https://essie.ufl.edu/people/name/xilei-zhao/). My doctoral research focuses on Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Travel Demand Modeling, Explainable AI, Shared Mobility, and Evacuation. Before becoming a Ph.D. student at UF, I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Transportation Engineering from the [College of Transportation Engineering](https://tjjt.tongji.edu.cn/English_Home/HOME.htm), [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/p/#/), where I studied vehicle motion planning and autonomous vehicle safety testing under the supervison of [Dr. Jian Sun](https://tops.tongji.edu.cn/info/1031/1187.htm).

My research philosophy is grounded in the belief that the potential of big data and AI is best unlocked when anchored by domain theory. Consequently, my work integrates transportation domain knowledge with advanced data-driven methods, including Machine Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Digital Twins, with applications in travel behavior, traffic safety, shared mobility, electrification of transport, autonomous vehicles, micromobility, and intelligent transportation systems. To date, I have authored more than 20 peer-reviewed journal papers and over 20 conference papers in AI, urban mobility, and transportation systems.

_I am seeking faculty opportunities starting in 2026 and welcome inquiries regarding collaboration or recruitment._
