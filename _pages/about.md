## Advancing Sustainable and Intelligent Urban Mobility through AI and Digital Twins

Hello and welcome! I am **Yiming Xu**, a researcher dedicated to shaping the future of urban mobility and intelligent transportation systems. My work integrates **AI, digital twins, and data-driven analytics** to enhance smart cities, sustainable transportation, and disaster response strategies.

### About Me
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin**, where I develop cutting-edge solutions for urban planning, autonomous systems, and emergency preparedness. My research spans across:

- **Urban Digital Twins**: Building real-time, AI-powered simulations of cities to support planning and decision-making.
- **Sustainable and Smart Mobility**: Exploring shared micromobility, transit accessibility, and traffic modeling.
- **AI for Disaster Response**: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and real-time data to improve emergency preparedness.
- **Autonomous Vehicle Research**: Analyzing AV safety, motion prediction, and urban integration.

With a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and a background in transportation engineering, I am passionate about bridging research and real-world applications to create more **efficient, safe, and resilient cities**.
