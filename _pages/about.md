Hello and welcome! I am **Yiming Xu**, a researcher dedicated to shaping the future of urban mobility and intelligent transportation systems. My work integrates **AI, digital twins, and data-driven analytics** to enhance smart cities, sustainable transportation, and disaster response strategies.

### About Me
I am currently a **Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas at Austin**, where I develop cutting-edge solutions for urban mobility, autonomous systems, and emergency preparedness. My research interests include:

- **Sustainable Mobility**: Shared mobility, micromobility, electric vehicles, and automated vehicles.
- **Transportation**: Travel demand modeling, travel behavior analysis, built environment, transportation economics, transportation safety.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: data analytics, LLMs, digital twin, machine learning, deep learning, trustworthy ML


With a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering and a background in transportation engineering, I am passionate about bridging research and real-world applications to create more **efficient, safe, and resilient transportation systems**.
