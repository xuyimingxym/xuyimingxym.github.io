The potential conflict area of intersection is the space where conflicting traffic flows pass through in the same signal phase. At this area, turning vehicles interact with most traffic flows, which introduce complex features including variation of trajectories and shared-priority phenomenon. The traditional one-dimensional simulation oversimplifies these features with lane-based assumption. This study integrates the modified social force model with behavior decision and movement constraints to reproduce the two-dimensional turning process. The method is framed into a three-layered mathematical model. First, the decision layer dynamically makes decision for turning patterns. Then the operation layer uses the modified social force model to initially generate vehicle movements. Finally, the constraint layer modifies the vehicular motion with vehicle dynamics constraints, boundary of intersection and the collision avoidance rule. The proposed model is validated using trajectories of left-turn vehicles at a real-world mixed-flow intersection with nonprotected signal phases, resulting in a more realistic simulation than previous methods. The distributions of decision points and travel time in simulation are compared with the empirical data in statistics. Moreover, the spatial distribution of simulated trajectories is also satisfactory.
